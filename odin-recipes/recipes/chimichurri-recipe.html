        <h1>Chimichurri</h1>
        <p>Chimichurri is an oil based condiment usually served with meat originating from Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 small red chillies</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoons of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes to release all of the flavours into the oil before using. Ideally, let it sit for more than 2 hours, if time allows.</li>
            <li>Chimichurri can be prepared earlier than needed, and refrigerated for 24 hours, if needed.</li>
            <li>Use to baste meats (chicken or steaks) while grilling or barbecuing. We don't use it as a marinade, but choose to baste our meats with chimichurri instead. However, you can use it as a marinade if you wish. Also, add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter with the oil in a large flameproof casserole. Add the chicken and cook for 10 to 12 minutes until browned all over. Lift out and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Spoon off any excess fat. Add the bacon, shallots or onions, and mushrooms. Cook over a high heat, stirring, until golden brown. </li>
            <li>Lift the mixture out of the pan with a slotted spoon and leave to drain thoroughly on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to the pan and cook for three to five minutes, stirring constantly, until lightly browned. Reduce the wine in a separate pan to 300 millilitres. Gradually pour in the stock, then the wine, stirring until smooth.</li>
            <li>Return the chicken and the bacon mixture to the casserole. Add the bouquet garni and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook in a preheated oven at 180Â°C/gas mark 4 for 45 minutes or until tender when pierced with a fork. Sprinkle the chicken with the chopped parsley.</li>

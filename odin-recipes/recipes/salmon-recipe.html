            <li>1/2 tsp salt , cooking / kosher</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>

            <li>90g / 6 tbsp salted butter , cut into cubes (or unsalted + 1/4 tsp salt)</li>
            <li>1 tsp lemon juice , plus more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tsp parsley , finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season salmon: Take salmon out of fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Sear salmon 3 mins: Heat oil in large non stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add salmon, presentation side (ie. curved side) down, and cook for 3 minutes until golden.</li>
            <li>Turn, cook 1 min, then add butter: Turn salmon and cook the other side for 1 minute. THEN put the butter in.</li>
            <li>Baste 1 1/2 minutes: Once butter is melted and foaming, add garlic and immediately start spooning the bubbling butter continuously over the salmon for 1 1/2 minutes. To do this, tilt the pan slightly so the butter pools on one side. Use a large spoon to scoop the butter up and spoon it over the salmon.</li>
            <li>Remove salmon from stove: Check Internal temperature of salmon. It should be 50째C/122째F for medium-rare (optimum juiciness pull temp). Remove salmon to a plate. Rest for 3 minutes - it will rise to 53째C/127째F. (See Note 2 for internal temperatures)</li>
            <li>Add lemon juice to butter: Put pan back on unlit stove to keep butter hot. Add lemon juice.</li>
        </ol>
